# Orange Belt Level 1 Challenge

## Part 1
Using the provided blocks, try your hand at:
 - Creating a Player Sprite. (Either make it yourself or use one from the gallery!)
 - Setting its position to somewhere in the screen! 

~hint Hint! Only use if you're stuck!
  Both the player sprite creation code and the set position code can be found in the Sprites tab!

## Part 2
Great Job! Now let's make the sprite able to move and make sure it cant go outside the screen!:
 - Make sure to set the sprite to Stay in the Screen.
 - Use controller code to move the sprite around when the buttons are pressed!
 - As a final challenge for this part, make the sprite say something when it appears on screen!

~hint Hint! Only use if you're stuck!
  The "Stay in Screen" code can be found in the Sprites tab, along with the "Say" code. Remember to replace the "Null" in the "Move with Buttons" code!

## Part 3
Now we have a fully functioning player! Let's put them in somewhere for them to move around in now.
 - You have the choice of either adding a background image.
 - Or a background color! Choose whichever fits your vision most!

~hint Hint! Only use if you're stuck!
  Make sure to only use one or the other, you cant see a background color under a background image!

## Part 4
Finally, it's time to make an enemy sprite that moves around on it's own without going outside the screen! We're also going to make it random for a extra challenge!
 - Just like before, you're going to make a new sprite! But this time you're going to make it's sprite kind an "Enemy"!
 - After making it, remember to set its position!
 - Then you're going to add in the bounce on wall code, so the enemy cant leave the game on accident!
 - Next, add the "Set Velocity" code so the enemy can move! The only problem is it moves the same way every time!
 - To fix this, replace each "50" with the randint code! Feel free to test out minimum and maximum numbers to use!

~hint Hint! Only use if you're stuck!
  Make sure the "Bounce on Wall" code is set to "True" or else it wont bounce at all! And if you find yourself wanting the sprite to go left or up instead of always right, try changing the minimum on the "randint"s to negative numbers! (Ex. -100)
